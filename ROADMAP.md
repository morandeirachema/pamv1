# pamv1 Roadmap

Guiding principle: **fully functional at every step**. Each phase ships something that runs end-to-end, passes tests, and deploys via IaC. Phases build on each other but stay independently releasable.

Status: ✅ done · 🚧 in progress · ⬜ planned

**Phases 0–12 are shipped** (through the configuration subsystem, custom-profile
RBAC, hot-swap, and the CyberArk/Wallix-style console). **Phase 13** (the
AI-agent access broker) is in progress — see their sections below. Beyond those,
a few items genuinely require external infrastructure to build and verify
honestly, so they are left as documented follow-ons rather than faked:

- **Optional Kerberos bind** (Phase 3b) — needs a KDC.
- **Browser RDP viewer** (Phase 4) — needs the vendored guacamole-common-js renderer + a real browser/guacd/RDP host (the server-side tunnel is done and tested).
- **Kerberos WinRM auth** (Phase 4) — needs a KDC + an AD-joined host.
- **Serial (RS-232 / terminal-server) connectors** (Phase 8) — needs serial hardware.

---

## Phase 0 — Project foundation ✅

- [x] Public open-source repo ([github.com/morandeirachema/pamv1](https://github.com/morandeirachema/pamv1)), Apache-2.0 license
- [x] Go module, standard layout (`cmd/`, `internal/`), CI on GitHub Actions (fmt, vet, build, race tests, Docker build)

## Phase 1 — Core: vault, inventory, audit, portal ✅

- [x] **Hardened vault**: AES-256-GCM, random nonce per secret, AAD binding to owning target, versioned token format (`v1:`) ready for key rotation
- [x] **Target inventory**: Linux/Windows machines (ssh / winrm / rdp) via REST API
- [x] **Credential store**: secrets encrypted before touching the DB; JSON encoder can never leak them; audited `reveal` as the temporary escape hatch
- [x] **Audit trail**: append-only events for every sensitive action
- [x] **Break-glass v1**: sealed emergency key (only its SHA-256 in config), loud `break-glass` actor, every use audited + logged
- [x] **Portal**: AS/400 / 5250-style terminal UI (Sign On, Work-with screens, F-keys) — deliberately austere so admins feel the gravity of the system
- [x] **Storage**: PostgreSQL (pgx) with embedded idempotent schema; in-memory store for tests/demo
- [x] **Deploy as IaC**: Dockerfile (distroless, non-root), docker-compose with hardened Postgres (scram-sha-256), K8s manifests (restricted PSS), Terraform module

## Phase 2 — Session proxy with JIT credential injection (Linux/SSH) ✅

The flagship: users connect *through* pamv1, never holding the credential.

- [x] SSH gateway (`golang.org/x/crypto/ssh`): user opens `ssh user@target@pam-proxy`, proxy authenticates the user, pulls the credential from the vault and injects it **just-in-time** into the upstream connection
- [x] Session recording (asciicast v2) stored with a SHA-256 written to the audit trail (tamper evidence)
- [x] Per-session audit events (start, record, end, denied, error)
- [x] **Per-target authorization** (`target_grants`): a target with grants only admits matching users/roles (admins always; ungranted targets stay open); enforced in the proxy, WinRM and RDP; managed via `/api/targets/{id}/grants`
- [x] **Live session listing and kill-switch** (`internal/session`): `GET /api/sessions` (auditor+) lists active proxy/RDP sessions; `DELETE /api/sessions/{id}` (admin) terminates one
- [x] **Hash-chain the recordings**: each recording's chain hash = SHA-256(prev-chain-hash ‖ file-hash), head persisted; recorded in the `session.record` audit (`chain:`)
- [x] Disable `reveal` by policy (`PAM_REVEAL_DISABLED`): reveal becomes break-glass-only, forcing the recorded proxy path

## Phase 3 — Identity & access control ✅

### 3a — RBAC with four profiles ✅

- [x] Four roles — **admin**, **user**, **auditor**, **approver** — with an authoritative role→capability matrix (`internal/auth`)
- [x] Per-user access tokens (stored as SHA-256 only), minted by an admin via `POST /api/users`
- [x] Enforcement in the REST API (per-route capability) and the SSH proxy (`CapConnect`); every denial audited (`authz.denied` / `session.denied`)
- [x] Audit now attributes real usernames; portal tolerates per-role 403s
- [x] `approver`'s approval endpoints (access-request workflow) — **shipped in Phase 8** (`/api/access-requests`, 4-eyes)

### 3b — Active Directory connector 🚧

- [x] LDAP/LDAPS bind against AD ([go-ldap](https://github.com/go-ldap/ldap)): service-account search + user bind to verify the password
- [x] AD groups → the four pamv1 roles (highest privilege wins), via `PAM_LDAP_GROUP_*`
- [x] Portal Sign On with AD username + password; short-lived **session tokens** (`POST /api/login`, `POST /api/logout`) that work in the portal and the SSH proxy
- [x] **MFA: TOTP** (RFC 6238) enrollment + verification (`internal/mfa`), secret stored vault-encrypted, enforced on `/api/login`; self-service `/api/mfa/*` (NIS2 Art. 21(2)(j))
- [x] **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** login: OAuth2 (ROPC) against the tenant, Entra app roles / groups → the four roles; composable with LDAP via a chain authenticator; sovereign-cloud authority host
- [x] **Enforce-MFA policy** (`PAM_MFA_REQUIRED`) with enrollment-only sessions, and **single-use recovery codes**
- [x] **OIDC Authorization Code flow + PKCE + JWKS signature validation** (`internal/oidc`): browser SSO (`/api/auth/oidc/{start,callback}`), IdP-side MFA/Conditional Access, ID-token verified (RS256, iss/aud/nonce/exp), discovery
- [ ] Optional Kerberos bind (needs a KDC to test)
- [x] Entra ROPC **id_token JWKS signature validation** — requests `openid`, validates the id_token's RS256 signature against the tenant JWKS (`oidc.VerifyRS256`) + audience + expiry before trusting role/group claims
- [x] OIDC pending-state shared store for multi-replica HA — **shipped in Phase 10** (`store.PutOIDCState`/`TakeOIDCState`, migration `0004`)
- [x] Local emergency admin kept for AD-down scenarios (bootstrap key + break-glass)

## Phase 4 — Windows targets ✅

- [x] **WinRM command execution with JIT credentials** (`internal/winrm`): `POST /api/targets/{id}/winrm` decrypts the target's credential only at run time, executes over WinRM, records the transcript (SHA-256 in the audit), returns stdout/stderr/exit — the caller never sees the secret
- [x] AD-joined target support: uses domain service accounts stored in the vault (the credential username may be `DOMAIN\\user` or UPN)
- [x] **NTLM WinRM auth** (`PAM_WINRM_AUTH=ntlm`) — NTLMv2 transport, which AD-joined hosts usually require
- [x] **RDP brokering via Apache Guacamole `guacd`** (`internal/guacd` + `GET /api/targets/{id}/rdp` WebSocket tunnel): the credential is injected just-in-time into the guacd handshake — it reaches guacd, never the browser (`PAM_GUACD_ADDR`)
- [ ] Browser RDP viewer: bundle guacamole-common-js and add a portal display (server-side tunnel is done and tested) — **infra-bound**: needs the vendored JS renderer plus a real browser + guacd + RDP host to verify end to end
- [x] guacd server-side session recording for RDP (`PAM_GUACD_RECORDING_PATH`; recording name in the `rdp.connect` audit)
- [ ] Kerberos WinRM auth — **infra-bound**: needs a KDC + an AD-joined Windows host to verify
- [x] **Interactive WinRM shell through the SSH proxy** (`PAM_PROXY_WINRM`): `ssh <cred>@<winrm-target>@pam` opens a command loop — each line runs as a WinRM command (JIT credential), output streams back and is recorded. (A command loop, not a stateful PowerShell — working directory/variables don't persist across lines; a WinRS streaming shell is a follow-on needing a real host to verify.)

## Phase 5 — Hardening: database, vault, transport ✅

- [x] **Envelope encryption** with a pluggable KEK: per-secret data keys wrapped by a Key Encryption Key; `local` KEK (dev/test) + **HashiCorp Vault Transit** KEK (production, KEK never leaves the KMS)
- [x] **Vault key rotation** (`pam-server -rotate-kek`, `internal/maint`): re-encrypts all credentials + MFA secrets from `PAM_MASTER_KEY` to `PAM_NEW_MASTER_KEY`, preserving AAD
- [x] Hardened Postgres guidance: scram-sha-256 enforced (compose), TLS `verify-full` + least-privilege role + [pgAudit](https://www.pgaudit.org/) documented
- [x] **Versioned migrations** (embedded, `schema_migrations` table, ordered `migrations/*.sql` applied in a transaction) replacing the ad-hoc startup schema
- [x] **Native HTTPS** (`PAM_TLS_CERT`/`PAM_TLS_KEY`, TLS 1.2+), **security headers** (nosniff, frame-deny, referrer, HSTS), **rate limiting** on auth endpoints (`PAM_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT`)
- [x] **Backup/restore runbook** with encrypted backups ([docs](docs/BACKUP-AND-RESTORE.md))
- [x] **Upstream SSH host-key pinning** (`PAM_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`, [known_hosts](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/knownhosts)): the JIT proxy and the rotation connector verify target host keys instead of trusting any; unconfigured falls back to trust-any with a loud warning
- [x] **AWS KMS KEK** (`aws-kms` provider): the data key is wrapped/unwrapped by KMS (`PAM_KEK_AWS_KEY_ID`/`PAM_KEK_AWS_REGION`); the CMK never leaves KMS
- [x] _(optional extension)_ **PKCS#11 HSM KEK provider** — `vault/pkcs11.go` behind the `pkcs11` build tag (cgo), `Dockerfile.pkcs11`, `PAM_KEK_PKCS11_*`; the AES wrapping key stays in the HSM. Verified against SoftHSM2 in CI; the default static image is unchanged (a stub returns "not built in")

## Phase 6 — Break-glass v2 ✅

- [x] **M-of-N quorum unseal** ([Shamir secret sharing](internal/shamir), `pam-server -split-key`, `POST /api/breakglass/unseal`): custodians submit shares; when M reconstruct the key (verified against its hash) a session is issued
- [x] **Auto-expiring break-glass sessions** (short-TTL session, `PAM_BREAK_GLASS_TTL_MIN`, scope `breakglass` → admin + loud audit)
- [x] **Real-time alerting** (`internal/alert` webhook, `PAM_ALERT_WEBHOOK`) on every break-glass **access** and **unseal**
- [x] Documented offline procedure (sealed shares, dual control) — see the [Admin Guide](docs/ADMIN-GUIDE.md)
- [x] Forced credential rotation after break-glass use — a break-glass session that connects through the proxy triggers `PAM_ROTATE_AFTER_SESSION` on session end (a reveal-path break-glass rotation is a smaller follow-on)
- [x] **Additional alert channels (email + syslog)** on the same `Notifier` interface (`alert.Syslog`, `alert.Email`, `alert.Multi` fan-out; `PAM_ALERT_SYSLOG` / `PAM_ALERT_EMAIL_*`)

## Phase 7 — Credential lifecycle ✅

- [x] **Rotation connectors** ([`internal/rotate`](internal/rotate)): Linux over SSH (`chpasswd` via stdin — no shell injection), Windows over WinRM (`net user`). Strong password generation from a shell-safe alphabet with guaranteed complexity categories. **`ssh_key` rotation**: generates a fresh ed25519 keypair and replaces the account's `authorized_keys` (old key stops working)
- [x] **On-demand rotation**: `POST /api/credentials/{id}/rotate` generates a fresh secret, sets it on the target, then re-vaults it and stamps `rotated_at` — the new secret is never returned (proxy injects it JIT)
- [x] **Scheduled rotation**: background lifecycle worker (`PAM_ROTATE_INTERVAL_MIN`) rotates password credentials older than `PAM_ROTATE_MAX_AGE_HOURS`
- [x] **Account reconciliation (out-of-sync detection & remediation):**
  - [x] Credential reconciliation — `POST /api/credentials/{id}/reconcile` verifies the vaulted secret still authenticates to the target (SSH handshake / WinRM probe); drift is flagged and, with `?remediate=true`, remediated by rotating to a PAM-managed secret
  - [x] Reconciliation scan — `GET /api/reconcile` reports drift across all credentials (read-only, safe to schedule), fully audited (`credential.reconcile`, `credential.rotate`, `credential.remediate`)
- [x] **Credential checkout/check-in with lease** — `POST /api/credentials/{id}/checkout` grants an exclusive, time-boxed lease (`PAM_CHECKOUT_TTL_MIN`) and returns the secret; `/checkin` ends it and **rotates** the credential so the seen password is invalidated. Enforced single-holder; honors the reveal-disabled policy
- [x] **Discovery** — `POST /api/discovery/scan` probes hosts for reachable management ports (SSH/WinRM/RDP) and can auto-onboard new targets (`internal/discovery`, reachability only — no credentials used)
- [x] **Identity reconciliation**: `POST /api/identity/reconcile[?dry_run=true]` checks every local user against the directory (`auth.DirectorySource.UserStatus`), **revokes disabled directory users** (`user.revoked`) and surfaces absent local-only accounts as `not_in_directory` (never revoked on uncertainty)
- [x] **AD/LDAPS password-change primitive** (`LDAPAuthenticator.ChangePassword` — Modify `unicodePwd`, UTF-16LE/quoted; unit-tested). *(Wiring it into a full AD-account rotation flow and real-DC interop is a follow-on.)*
- [x] **Forced rotation after each proxied SSH session ends** (`PAM_ROTATE_AFTER_SESSION`): the proxy's `OnSessionEnd` hook calls `Server.RotateCredentialByID`, so a secret used in one session can't be reused in the next (covers break-glass proxied sessions too)

## Phase 8 — OT adaptation ✅

Designed for industrial environments ([IEC 62443](https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-iec-62443-series-of-standards), Purdue model) — see the [OT Deployment Guide](docs/OT-DEPLOYMENT.md):

- [x] **Session approval workflow (4-eyes)**: `POST /api/access-requests` → approver (a *different* principal, `CapApprove`) approves/denies; `access_requests` table; enforced on **every** connect path (SSH proxy, WinRM, RDP); break-glass bypasses; approvals/denials audited + alerted. Per-target (`require_approval`) or global (`PAM_REQUIRE_APPROVAL`), time-boxed (`PAM_APPROVAL_WINDOW_MIN`)
- [x] **Air-gap/offline mode** (`PAM_OT_AIRGAP`): disables all outbound calls (alert webhooks); alerts still hit the audit trail + local logs
- [x] Deployment pattern for the industrial DMZ (level 3.5) documented (Purdue diagram, firewall guidance, IEC 62443 control mapping)
- [x] **Protocol allowlisting** (`PAM_ALLOWED_PROTOCOLS`): restrict which target protocols may be created/connected (e.g. forbid RDP in an OT zone); enforced at create-target and on every connect path (API + proxy)
- [x] **Read-only observer sessions**: `ssh <cred>@<target>+observe@pam` opens a view-only session — output streams and is recorded, but operator keystrokes are dropped and exec/subsystem requests are refused (`mode:observer` in the audit)
- [x] **Jump-host / bastion connector** (`PAM_SSH_JUMP_*`): reach SSH targets only accessible via an SSH bastion — the proxy tunnels a `direct-tcpip` channel through the jump host (public-key auth, per-dial bastion connection)
- [ ] Serial connectors (RS-232 / terminal servers) for legacy equipment — needs serial hardware (follow-on)

## Phase 9 — NIS2 compliance pack ✅

Mapping to [Directive (EU) 2022/2555](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2022/2555/oj) — see the [NIS2 Compliance Pack](docs/NIS2-COMPLIANCE.md):

- [x] **Control matrix doc**: full Art. 21(2)(a–j) measure ↔ pamv1 feature mapping
- [x] **Incident reporting export** (Art. 23): `GET /api/audit/export` returns a scoped audit slice (`since`/`until`/`actor`/`action`, JSON or CSV) with a **SHA-256 tamper-evidence digest** (body field + `X-PAM-Export-SHA256` header); the export is itself audited
- [x] **Audit retention + SIEM forwarding** guidance (append-only trail in Postgres; JSON logs + audit events to stdout for a collector; real-time alert webhook)
- [x] **Risk-management documentation template** for essential/important entities

## Phase 10 — Scale & operations ✅

- [x] **Observability**: Prometheus `/metrics` (`internal/metrics`, dependency-free exposition — request counts by status, audit volume, break-glass use, rotations, active-sessions gauge), structured JSON logs, **health/readiness split** (`/healthz` liveness + `/readyz` store-reachability readiness, `store.Ping`)
- [x] **Helm chart** (`deploy/helm/pamv1`): deployment/service/secret/ingress/ServiceMonitor, configurable replicas, PVC or emptyDir, hardened pod security context
- [x] **Signed releases** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): build + push by digest on a version tag, **SBOM** (SPDX) generation + attestation, **cosign** keyless image signing, GitHub Release
- [x] **HA — OIDC login state shared** via the store (migration `0004`, `store.PutOIDCState`/`TakeOIDCState`), so the auth-code callback can land on any replica. The auth rate-limiter stays best-effort per-replica; break-glass quorum-unseal keeps its shares in memory **by design** (persisting key shares to the DB would weaken the offline-shares guarantee — use a sticky session or a single replica for the unseal flow)
- [x] **Postgres HA** via [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/): a 3-instance `Cluster` manifest (`deploy/k8s/postgres-cnpg.yaml`, automatic failover, scram-sha-256, optional PITR)
- [x] **Terraform module for cloud-managed Postgres** (`deploy/terraform/cloud-postgres/` — AWS RDS example: multi-AZ, encrypted, `force_ssl`)
- [x] **SLSA build provenance** attested on release (`actions/attest-build-provenance` in `release.yml`, pushed to the registry alongside the cosign signature + SBOM)

## Phase 11 — Management console ✅

The AS/400 5250 green-terminal portal grows from 3 screens into a full
management console covering every backend capability (CyberArk/Wallix-grade
*coverage*, IBM 5250 *look*). Still one `//go:embed`'d page, vanilla JS,
nonce-CSP, no build step — the retro aesthetic is a deliberate constraint, not a
limitation.

- [x] **Role-aware menu** — `GET /api/me` returns the caller's identity + the stable capability names its role holds; the main menu shows only the options the role may use (panels still tolerate a 403 as a backstop)
- [x] **Targets** — subfile with delete + *work-with-grants*, `require_approval` on add; **target grants** screen (list/add/delete role- or user-scoped access)
- [x] **Credentials** — reveal (audited), **check-out** (leased secret + expiry), rotate, reconcile, delete
- [x] **Check-out / check-in** — active exclusive leases; check-in rotates the secret
- [x] **Active sessions** — live monitor (auto-refresh) of proxied SSH/WinRM/RDP sessions with a kill switch
- [x] **Access requests** — 4-eyes: approvers see pending requests and approve/deny; connect-capable users file requests
- [x] **Users & roles** — mint one-time tokens, delete, run directory reconciliation
- [x] **MFA self-service** — enroll (secret + otpauth), confirm, recovery codes, disable
- [x] **Discovery** — scan hosts for reachable SSH/WinRM/RDP and optionally onboard as targets
- [x] **Reconciliation report** — read-only drift scan across all credentials
- [x] **Audit trail** — client-side filter + tamper-evident CSV export (SHA-256)
- [x] **Break-glass unseal** — submit an M-of-N quorum share; on quorum an audited, auto-expiring admin session is issued

## Phase 12 — Configuration subsystem & custom profiles ✅

Make identity backends, policies, and permission profiles configurable from the
console — the CyberArk/Wallix administration surface — using a **hybrid** model
that respects the project's IaC-first roots.

- [x] **Hybrid config model**: directory bindings (LDAP/AD, **Kerberos**), SSO (Entra/OIDC), and policies become editable settings **persisted in the DB** and applied on save; the authenticator chain is rebuilt from stored config — *shipped*: the DB-persisted, vault-encrypted settings store + `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/config` overlaid onto the env config, **plus hot-swap without a restart** (an atomic `runtimeConf` snapshot rebuilt by a `Reconfigure` closure, with rollback on a rejected change; bootstrap/transport/listeners stay env-only and restart-bound)
- [x] **Networking/TLS stays IaC**: a read-only effective-config + backend-health screen (`GET /api/config/effective`) plus a generator (`GET /api/config/iac?format=env|helm|terraform`) that exports the console-set overrides back to IaC, secrets rendered as secret-store placeholders (never plaintext); listeners/ports/TLS stay env-only
- [x] **Custom permission profiles**: named capability sets assignable to users (a configurable RBAC engine), with the current 4 roles as built-in defaults; assignment surfaced in *Work with users & profiles* — *shipped*: `profiles` table (migration `0009`), `POST/GET /api/profiles` + `DELETE /api/profiles/{id}`, `auth.Principal.Can` resolving a capability set (built-in roles unchanged), `createUser` accepting a profile name, and the console role/profile picker now loading custom profiles live
- [x] Console screens (5250 style) to manage profiles (menu 12), identity/SSO/policy configuration (menu 13), and effective config + backend health with IaC export (menu 14); Kerberos *config* is expressible via the generic `PAM_*` override editor even though live Kerberos auth needs a KDC to exercise (see the infra-bound list above)

## Phase 13 — AI-agent access broker 🚧

PAM for AI agents (ports [`morandeirachema/pam-research`](https://github.com/morandeirachema/pam-research)): an agent holds only an identity key; a policy engine decides `allow / require_approval / deny` on a tool call **and its arguments**; approved actions execute **server-side** with a just-in-time credential; the agent receives only the result. "Trust the chokepoint, not the agent." Opt-in via `PAM_BROKER_POLICY_FILE`; brokers pamv1's own operations with JIT vault injection.

- [x] **Policy engine** (`internal/policy`): YAML rules (`eq`/`not`/`in`/`not_in`), first-match-wins, implicit deny, scope templating, fail-loud loader
- [x] **Agent identity** (`internal/agentid`): static bearer keys (`agent_keys`, SHA-256 hash lookup), `RoleAgent` + `CapCallTool`
- [x] **Tool registry + JIT execution**: `winrm_exec` over the refactored `execWinRM` — decrypts just-in-time, returns only the result (proven: the runner gets the vaulted secret, the response leaks nothing)
- [x] **Verifiable audit chain** (`internal/auditchain`): keyed-HMAC per-event hash chain (`broker_audit_events`) + `/v1/audit/verify` + ed25519-signed head checkpoint for truncation detection
- [x] **REST surface**: `POST /v1/tool-calls`, `GET /v1/tool-calls/{id}`, `POST /v1/agents`, `GET /v1/audit[/verify|/head]`; HTTP-200-with-status error model
- [ ] **Approval + resume + short-lived single-use tokens**: `require_approval` effect, park/resume, execute-on-approve (reusing the 4-eyes + alert path), JTI single-use `broker_tokens`; tools `rotate_credential`, `reveal_credential` (default-deny), `list_targets`/`list_credentials`, `ssh_exec`; per-agent rate limits + arg caps
- [ ] **MCP server** (`internal/mcp`): JSON-RPC 2.0 `/mcp` (`initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`, `broker/resume`) sharing the one policy loop
- [ ] **SPIFFE JWT-SVID + RFC 8693 delegation**: verified agent identity + actor-chains (reusing the `internal/oidc` JWT/JWKS machinery)
- Deferred (documented): SPIRE workload attestation, RFC 8693 token-**exchange** minting, MCP SSE/elicitation, KEK-wrapping the audit keys, multi-replica chain writer
